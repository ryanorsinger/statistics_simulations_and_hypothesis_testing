### List of Topics
- Descriptive Statistics
- Probability Distributions
- Hypothesis Testing

### Goals
- Understand how to use uniform, binomial, poisson, and normal distributions to model real-world scenarios
- Know when to use a t-test, correlation test, and 
- Perform statistical simulations w/ Python
- Perform hypothesis testing in Python

### Descriptive Statistics
- Describe the data (focusing on a single variable)
- Measures of central tendancy: 
    - mean
    - expected value (where each value is weighted by its probability)
    - median
    - mode
- Measures of spread:
    - min and max
    - range (difference between min and max)
    - quantile
    - quartile
    - percentile
    - IQR (interquartile range) is Q3 - Q1 (75th percentile - 25th percentile)
    - Variance (1/n)*∑(xi−μ)2
    - Standard Deviation = sqrt(variance)
    - Skew
