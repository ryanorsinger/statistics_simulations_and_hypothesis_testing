### List of Topics
- Descriptive Statistics
- Probability Distributions
- Hypothesis Testing

### Goals
- Understand how to use uniform, binomial, poisson, and normal distributions to model real-world scenarios
- Know when to use a t-test, correlation test, and 
- Perform statistical simulations w/ Python
- Perform hypothesis testing in Python

### Descriptive Statistics
- Describe the data (focusing on a single variable)
- Measures of central tendancy: 
    - mean
    - expected value (where each value is weighted by its probability)
    - median
    - mode
- Measures of spread:
    - min and max
    - range (difference between min and max)
    - quantile
    - quartile
    - percentile
    - IQR (interquartile range) is Q3 - Q1 (75th percentile - 25th percentile)
    - Standard Deviation = sqrt(variance)
    - Skew
    <!-- - Variance (1/n)*∑(xi−μ)2 -->

## Measures of Central Tendency

- Mean: `sum(numbers) / len(numbers)`
- Expected Value is similar to the average, except that each value is eighted by its probability.
- Median: the center or middle value. When there are an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle points.
- Mode is the most frequently occuring value
- Bi-Modal is when two values tie for the mode.
- min
- max
- range is the difference between the max and the min
- A Quantile is a distribution of values cut into a number of equally sized continuous intervals
